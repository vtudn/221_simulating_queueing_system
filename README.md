# simulating_queueing_system

**SCENARIO**: Simulate queueing system M/M/1/K in comparison with M/M/1, then analyze the customer rejection rate between two queues.

**GOALS**:
- To calculate the performance metrics of a M/M/1/k/♾️ then simulate.
- To study the impact of the parameters on the system's performance metrics.
- To analyze the customer rejection rate.
- To compare the simulation result withs the analytical results.

**BOUNDARIES**:
- Jupyter Notebook to run the scripts and visualize data.
- Python 3.10.7 as interpreter.

**PERFORMANCE METRICS**:
- Interarrival time.
- Average service time of a job.
- Average waiting time of a job.
- Capacity of the system.
